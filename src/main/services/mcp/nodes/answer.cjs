The user's query contains a pronoun ("he", "she", "it", "they", etc.).

MANDATORY STEPS:
1. FIRST: Read the conversation history to identify who/what "he/she/it/they" refers to
2. Look at the most recent 2-3 assistant messages to see who was being discussed
3. ONLY AFTER identifying the person from context, use web search results to answer about THAT SPECIFIC PERSON
4. IGNORE web search results about other people - they are irrelevant

The user is responding to your previous question with a short affirmative phrase.

MANDATORY STEPS:
1. Look at your MOST RECENT assistant message to see what question you asked
2. The user's response is answering that question - identify which option/topic they chose
3. Address THAT SPECIFIC TOPIC mentioned in their response
4. Stay on topic - don't switch to a different subject

Example:
- You asked: "Would you like to know about his hobbies or medical conditions?"
- User says: "yes football"
- You should: Talk about football/hobbies, NOT medical conditions
