IMPORTANT:
- When the user refers to "the show", "the cartoon", "he", "she", "it", or "they", check the conversation history to understand what they're referring to.
- If the user asks to "go back" to a previous topic, find that topic in the conversation history and continue it.
- Do not ask the user to repeat information that's already in the conversation history.
- Always respond from the assistant's perspective (use "you" for the user, not "I").`;

STEP 2: Find the SECOND user message that has "[MOST RECENT USER MESSAGE]" at the very start.
STEP 3: Extract ONLY the text AFTER "[MOST RECENT USER MESSAGE] " (note the space).
STEP 4: Respond with EXACTLY: "You asked: [extracted text]"

Example conversation history:
